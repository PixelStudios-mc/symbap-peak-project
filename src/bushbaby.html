      Bushbabies, also known as galagos or night monkeys are cute omnivores that pollinate the white flowers on Baobab trees while the trees provide cover for the bushbabies in return.
      
      Bushbabies usually eat fruit, insects, and the gum that oozes out of some trees. Sometimes larger galagos will eat smaller animals, such as frogs or birds.
      Galagos are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and East Africa (Savannas mostly) as well as woodlands, rainforests, and bushlands. They generally live in trees.
      Mongooses, genets, jackals, domestic dogs and cats, owls, and snakes sometimes eat bushbabies.
      As human populations grow, they encroach on wildlife habitats as they build new settlements, increase agricultural production, and construct new roads which can hurt Bushbabies and Baobab trees home. Luckily there are lots of them!
